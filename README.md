# micro-python

This repo documents my journey in Flashing Micro Python to both an ESP32 and ESP8266 for the first time using my Mac.

I then set up Jupyter to host a Micro Python Kernel.

It ultimately lead to creating a Micro Python Notebook on an ESP8266 that communicates with the Adafruit MQTT Broker.
